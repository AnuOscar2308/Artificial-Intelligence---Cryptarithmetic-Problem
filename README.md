# Artificial-Intelligence - Cryptarithmetic-Problem

# Project Description: 
Design and implement a program to solve Cryptarithmetic problems as shown in the figure below:

where 𝑥1 to 𝑥13 can be any capital letter from A to Z; some letters may occur more than once. Each letter stands for a distinct digit; the aim is to find a substitution of digits for letters such that the
resulting sum is arithmetically correct, with the added restriction that no leading zeros are allowed. The domain for 𝑥9 is therefore {1}, the domain for 𝑥1 and 𝑥5 is {1,2, … , 9} and the domain for variables 𝑥2 to 𝑥4, 𝑥6 to 𝑥8, and 𝑥10 to 𝑥13 is {0,1,2, … , 9}. You can introduce auxiliary variables and specify their domains to represent carry overs from previous columns. After this, you can set up a set of constraints for the problem.
